### 🔍 Vulnerability Hunting
If you are a Vulnerability Hunter and want to try to get some money from my website, I will contribute a final payment to you to send me the vulnerability report and a possible solution for it. The payment will be made after the report and before the solution, so that the Vulnerability Hunter doesn't have any disadvantage about it.
